# Synonysaurus

## Ann Cerveny

## Description

Synonysaurus is a synonym-generating application that implements front-end functionality, Vue.js, and the Merriam-Webster API to allow users to type in a term and generate a series of synonyms. Should the user wish to generate synonyms based on the existing result, they are able to click on the dinosaur egg to then generate respective synonyms for said term. This project was the 5-day final solo project for the Mod 4 front-end engineering curriculum at the Turing School of Software and Design, in which we were tasked with learning an unfamiliar framework - Vue.js - and integrating the Merriam-Webster API, along with our respective API key. Through conditional rendering, a newly-learned syntax, and a experimenting with applying API keys, Synonysaurus is a light-hearted take on a user-friendly synonym generator.
